# Bent Crystal Spectroscopy for Pebble Bed Reactors
This work includes a Jupyter notebook for analysis, as well as accompanying data and scripts. This code is intended to accompany Chapter 2 of my dissertation, "Advanced Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Pebble Bed Reactors", as well as my upcoming published paper "Burnup Measurement using Bent Crystal Spectrometer for Pebble Bed Reactors."

## Zenodo Data
Some of the data used in this study is larger than is supported by Github. You can access those files, archived for as long as CERN exists, on Zenodo. This is required to reproduce the whole data generation process, but not the regression pipeline.

## Where To Start
I recommend reading the paper or dissertation chapter first. The "main_notebook.ipynb" file contains most of the analysis that accompanies this work, while "batch_scripts" has python scripts that do large batches of Serpent runs. Single example calculations are shown, which should suffice for understanding how these calculations were performed.

## Using This Work
This work has the MIT license, which makes using it pretty permissible. Please note that a provisional patent has been filed for the process of measuring the burnup and isotope quantities of discharged fuel from continuously fueled reactors with a bent crystal spectrometer.
